            <p>
                Riding my bike has done wonders for my stress levels. My school can be stressful at times and I used to feel overwhelmed by it. I have found that going on a bike ride after school allows me to keep my stress under control during next my day at school and that riding my bike when I get home is the perfect way to relax.The unique feeling I have on a bike is the freedom I feel wherever I am or wherever I am going. I never feel obliged to take the same route when I am on a cycle path. I can choose to go where my mind takes me. I can go where I want, when I want.
